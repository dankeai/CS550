Assignment 1
============

## 1. Agents
In order to prevent infections from E. Coli, ensuring that the food reaches a minimum internal temperature of 160° F. A precept that could be implemented to ensure that food is free of E. Coli would be to monitor the temperature of the soup as it is being prepared.

| Precept                     | Action                  |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| Food reaches 160° F.        | Food is ready to serve! |
| Food does not reach 160° F. | Do not serve!           |

## 2. Problem 3.6b from the text
**Initial State:** There are two 3 foot crates that can be moved by the monkey (3ft tall), who cannot currently reach the bananas on the celling (8ft in height).

**Goal State/Test:** The Monkey can reach the tasty bananas.

**Successor:** RESULT(Starting Stack, Add(Crate) / Remove(Crate)) = Crate Stack

**Cost Function:** The number of bananas the monkey can reach (initially 0). We could also define cost by how long it takes the monkey to get the bananas. It depends on what we are optimizing for, bananas or speed.
